description: "Deploy your apps to multiple servers remotely."

import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

Multi server allows you to deploy your apps remotely to different servers without needing to build and run them where the Dokploy UI is installed.

To use the multi-server feature, you need to have Dokploy UI installed either locally or on a remote server. We recommend using a remote server for better connectivity, security, and isolation, for remote instances we install only a traefik instance.

If you plan to only deploy apps to remote servers and use Dokploy UI for managing deployments, Dokploy will use around 250 MB of RAM and minimal CPU, so a low-resource server should be sufficient.

All the features we have documented previously are supported by Dokploy Multi Server. The only feature not supported is remote server monitoring, due to performance reasons. However, all functionalities should work the same as when deploying on the same server where Dokploy UI is installed.

## Features

1. **Enter the terminal**: Allows you to access the terminal of the remote server.
2. **Setup Server**: Allows you to configure the remote server.
   - **SSH Keys**: Steps to add SSH keys to the remote server.
   - **Deployments**: Steps to configure the remote server for deploying applications.
3. **Edit Server**: Allows you to modify the remote server's details, such as SSH key, name, description, IP, etc.
4. **View Actions**: Lets you perform actions like managing the Traefik instance, storage, and activating Docker cleanup.
5. **Show Traefik File System**: Displays the contents of the remote server's directory.
6. **Show Docker Containers**: Shows the Docker containers running on the remote server.
